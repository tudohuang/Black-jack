# Simple Blackjack Game

This is a simple text-based Blackjack game created in Python.

## Game Rules

- The game starts with the player having 1000 chips.
- The player bets a certain amount of chips.
- The player and the dealer are each given two cards. The player can see both of their cards, but can only see one of the dealer's cards.
- The player can choose to 'hit' (take another card) or 'stand' (not take another card). The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. If the player goes over 21, they 'bust' and lose the game.
- If the player chooses to 'stand', the dealer will reveal their hidden card and continue to draw cards until they have 17 or more. If the dealer goes over 21, they 'bust' and the player wins.
- If neither the player nor the dealer 'bust', then whoever is closest to 21 wins the game. If it's a tie, it's called a 'push' and no chips are won or lost.
- The player can choose to play another round or end the game.
